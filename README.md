The research aim is to develop ML algorithms to analyze out-of-band network traffic data to identify anomalous or novel behavior. First, ML algorithms will be trained with the modern-day BETH cybersecurity dataset. The training will provide the ML algorithms with a baseline of standard network activity. The training data set will include vast records of network activity, providing ample data to build a normal profile. Next, it is hypothesized that the ML algorithms will detect malicious network activity in a test data set as anomalous or novel. Well-performing algorithms should identify malicious activity as anomalous with high true positive rates and low false positive rates or specificity.

Anomaly detection is an unsupervised ML technique, while novelty detection is a semisupervised technique. The study will assess the performance of unsupervised and semisupervised ML techniques with the BETH cybersecurity dataset that contains malicious network activity. Well-performing ML techniques are candidates for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) implementation. In addition, novelty detection, the ability to recognize never-seen-before events as different, has the potential for zero-day attack detection.
